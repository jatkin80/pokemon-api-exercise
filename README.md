## Pokemon API

Still need to work through creating the link for individual pokePeople.

Link to deployed API https://julies-poke-api.herokuapp.com/api/pokemon

- Return individual pokemon in this format:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "bulbasaur",
  "sprites": {
    "front_default": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/1.png"
  }
}
```

- Create new pokemon
- Update existing pokemon
- Delete pokemon

Finally, create a README with a link to your deployed API.
